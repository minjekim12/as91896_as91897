Julie's Party Hire
This program will help keep track of which items are currently 
being hired with information such as the customer's full name,
reciept number, item name and quantity. The user can choose rows 
on the hire list to delete once items are returned.

The program also allows a group to delete their row by choosing which row
to delete if they are moving on.
