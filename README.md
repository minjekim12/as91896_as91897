Julie's Party Hire

Julie runs a party hire store and has a range of items for hire. She needs to keep a
track of items that are currently out. 

This program will let the user input the following details : Customer Full Name, Reciept Number, Item name and Quantity. 

To ensure that the data collected from user input is reasonable, program will put out an error message instead so the user can input good sets of data. 

The user can then append the details that they have put, and input another sets of data if needed.
