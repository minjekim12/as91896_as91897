Julie's Party Hire List is a program that helps the user store multiple rows of data in a list. 

## Description

To use, simply run the program and input the data in the boxes. If the data is invalid, the program will not work, make sure the data input is accurate. Then press "append" to store details and clear boxes. Now the user can either : input another sets of data and append or print all stored details on the list. The user can also select rows to delete when not needed anymore.
